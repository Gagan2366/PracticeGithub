The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that describes how different networking technologies and protocols interact with each other. The OSI model consists of seven layers, each with a specific function:

Physical Layer: This is the lowest layer in the OSI model and is responsible for the physical transmission of data over a communication channel. It defines the physical characteristics of the transmission medium, such as the voltage levels, signaling rate, and connector type.

Data Link Layer: This layer is responsible for the reliable transmission of data over a physical link. It performs tasks such as error detection and correction, flow control, and framing.

Network Layer: The network layer is responsible for the transmission of data between different networks. It provides services such as addressing, routing, and congestion control.

Transport Layer: The transport layer is responsible for the reliable transmission of data between end systems. It provides services such as segmentation, flow control, and error recovery.

Session Layer: The session layer is responsible for establishing, managing, and terminating sessions between applications. It provides services such as session establishment, synchronization, and checkpointing.

Presentation Layer: The presentation layer is responsible for the representation and transformation of data between different applications. It provides services such as data compression, encryption, and data format conversion.

Application Layer: The application layer is the highest layer in the OSI model and is responsible for providing services to end users. It includes protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, and FTP.

Each layer in the OSI model has a specific function and communicates with adjacent layers using well-defined interfaces. By using a layered approach, the OSI model provides a framework for designing and implementing networking protocols and technologies that can work together in a standardized way.
